Note on [psuedocode](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/0/#pseudocode); 
    - treat this as a complete thought of what you are trying to do. Type it out all of the way; consider corner cases, one of things that could happen, expected outcome, etc. 
    - Functions and conditionals can be in your psuedocode as well naturally but thinking of what you are trying to solve for. Functions can be things actions or verbs in the code and conditionals can be things like fork in the road or a decision tree you need to have. 
        - The questions we are looking for answers to in the decision tree are our boolean logics. Which most of the time are yes or no, or true or false, or "and or OR" ;) 
    - Loops are just ways to go back to the function to repeat myself until I get the answer I want!
